# surfRate
Simple application intergrated with leaflet library. It is designed to be able to track surf sessions on diffrent spots. 
By clicking on the map you will be able to add a spot and after that you will be able to record sessions. 
In the sessions there will be not only your experience recorded but also a call to stormglass api to get some additional data.
Feel free to look around but please be careful with the "adding new sessions" since its limited (free api of stormglass limits to 10 calls per day). 
It is still a very early version which need allot of tweaking and adjustments.
